## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-20

### 🎉 Initial Release - Unified Media API

First official release of the media_picker package with a clean, unified API for managing images, videos, and documents in Flutter applications.

### ✨ Features

#### Unified Media API
- **Three Simple Methods**: All media operations through `getMediasFromCamera`, `getMediasFromGallery`, and `getMediasFromFiles`
- **Mixed Media Selection**: Pick multiple media types in a single call (e.g., 5 images + 3 videos + 10 documents)
- **Type-Safe Pattern Matching**: Sealed class `MediaEntity` with `ImageMedia`, `VideoMedia`, and `DocumentMedia` variants
- **Path-Based Storage**: All entities use file paths (no Uint8List) for memory efficiency

#### Media Sources
- **Camera**: Capture images and videos with metadata support (documents not supported)
- **Gallery**: Select images and videos from device gallery (documents not supported)
- **Files**: Pick images, videos, and documents from device storage (all types supported, web compatible)

#### Camera Features
- **Four Metadata Strategies**:
  - `selectable`: User selects from overlay labels before each capture
  - `sequential`: Auto-assign metadata in sequence order (no overlay)
  - `shared`: Same metadata for all captures (no overlay)
  - `hybrid`: Sequential for first N, then fallback for remaining
- **Video Capture**: Support for video recording with duration limits and quality settings
- **Photo & Video Mode**: Switch between photo and video modes or enable both
- **Camera Roll**: Built-in preview and management of captured media
- **Customizable UI**: Configure colors, text styles, and overlay appearance

#### Configuration
- **MediaSelectionOptions**: Flexible configuration with:
  - Per-type limits (`maxImages`, `maxVideos`, `maxDocuments`)
  - Overall limit (`maxTotal`)
  - File type filters (by extension)
  - Compression settings (images only)
  - Camera configuration
- **Convenience Factories**: `.imagesOnly()`, `.videosOnly()`, `.documentsOnly()`

#### Smart Compression
- **Automatic Image Compression**: Configurable quality, dimensions, and format
- **Path-Based Pipeline**: Compress from path to path (no memory loading)
- **Web Compatible**: Works seamlessly on web platform

#### Type Safety
- **Sealed Class MediaEntity**: Exhaustive pattern matching with compiler checks
- **Either Pattern**: Type-safe error handling with `Either<MediaFailure, List<MediaEntity>>`
- **Freezed Models**: Immutable entities with automatic copyWith, equality, and pattern matching
- **Compile-Time Safety**: No runtime type casting needed

#### Permission Handling
- **Built-In Management**: Automatic permission requests and status tracking
- **Typed Failures**: Permission denial returns `PermissionDenied` failure
- **Platform-Specific**: Handles iOS, Android, and web permission differences

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of Domain, Data, and Presentation layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Riverpod providers for loose coupling (internal only)
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract interfaces with concrete implementations
- **Use Case Pattern**: Domain logic encapsulated in use cases
- **Framework Agnostic**: No Riverpod knowledge required for users

### 📦 Public API

Users interact with:
1. `MediaPicker` - Static facade with 3 methods
2. `MediaEntity` - Sealed class (ImageMedia/VideoMedia/DocumentMedia)
3. `MediaMetadataEntity` - Unified metadata for all types
4. `MediaSelectionOptions` - Configuration class
5. `CameraConfig` - Camera-specific configuration
6. `CameraMetadataStrategy` - Sealed class for metadata strategies
7. `Either<MediaFailure, T>` - Error handling pattern

### 🔐 Validation

- **Media Scope Validation**: Camera and Gallery reject document requests with typed failures
- **Type Filters**: Validate file extensions against allowed types
- **Quantity Limits**: Enforce maxImages, maxVideos, maxDocuments constraints

### 🌐 Platform Support

- ✅ iOS - Full camera, gallery, and file support
- ✅ Android - Full camera, gallery, and file support
- ✅ Web - File picker only (no camera/gallery)
- ✅ macOS - File picker only
- ✅ Windows - File picker only
- ✅ Linux - File picker only

### 📚 Documentation

### 📋 Requirements

- Flutter SDK: >=3.0.0
- Dart SDK: >=3.0.0

### 🎯 Design Decisions

#### Why Sealed Classes?
- Exhaustive pattern matching ensures all media types are handled
- Compile-time safety prevents missing case statements
- Dart 3 feature for modern type-safe code

#### Why Path-Based Storage?
- Memory efficient for large media files
- Consistent across all media types
- Web compatible via temporary files
- No need to load entire files into memory

#### Why Unified API?
- Simpler API surface (3 methods instead of 5+)
- Consistent return types across all operations
- Easier to learn and use
- Better type safety with sealed classes

#### Why Strategy Pattern for Camera Metadata?
- Four distinct use cases with no overlap
- Type-safe selection via sealed class
- No boolean flags or validation needed
- Each strategy is self-contained

#### Why Internal Riverpod?
- Framework-agnostic public API
- Users don't need Riverpod knowledge
- CameraView creates internal ProviderScope
- Clean separation of concerns
